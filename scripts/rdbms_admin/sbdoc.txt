STANDBY STATSPACK UPGRADE NOTE (11.1.0.7 & 11.2.0.1 Customers)

In order to upgrade to 11.2.0.2, one must must drop and
recreate the standby statspack.

To support multiple standby database configurations,
11.2.0.2 standby statspack uses a new *primary key* (db_unique_name, instance_name).
This new feature requires customers who upgrade to drop and
recreate the stdbyperf schema.

Exception: Customers who have applied the BLR patch, ie, their stats$ tables
already *patched* and *switched* to the new *primary key* do not need
to recreate the standby statspack schema.
